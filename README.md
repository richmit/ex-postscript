Postscript is more than an just a vector image file format, it is a
programming language. As a programming language, it may be exploited
to great advantage for mathematical illustrations.  This repository
has a few examples.

You can read a bit more about these examples on my [home page](https://www.mitchr.me/SS/exampleCode/postscript.html).

Have fun!
